Quick Reports - James Jasinski

This was an Android Studio group project completed as part of a Software Engineering course.
It is an application designed to help the user generate and organize vehicle accident reports while using the
phone's features to automatically gather location and weather data to save in the report.

I was primarily responsible for implementing access to the phone's GPS system and third-party weather API calls.
I also created our mockup of the application's user interface.

Note that the full code of the final product is not here as we did not use proper version control at the time
and ended up merging our code together on the spot. I do not have a copy of the final project, but
the project folder in this repository contains the code I contributed to it.
